created a self driving 2d car. You can change the number of cars spawning through a function which generates the cars.
The cars then follow a random path while moving through traffic.
The save button has been implemented to save the trajectory of any particular car which passes through some traffic. 
Upon multiple tries and saving, you can manage to find atleast 1 car which drives itself through all the traffic.
